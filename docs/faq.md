## My MP3 file is not being played

For some reason, not all mp3 files are supported. If playing an mp3 file does not give any exceptions,
but you can not hear it in game, it might be because the mp3 file is nog supported. To correct this, use
[a tool](https://online-audio-converter.com/) to create an mp3 file that is supported.
