 * {@link Collider}. In such a case, the {@link Collided} is the {@link YaegerEntity} that
 * gets notified of the collision.
 *
 * <p>There are different types of collision detection. In the case of an {@link Collided} we perform so called
 * <b>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box</b> collision detection, which required the instances of {@link YaegerEntity}
 * to not be {@link Rotatable}. </p>
 *
 * <p>Each Game world Update a {@link Collided} is checked against all instances of{@link Collider}. If many instances
 * of {@link Collider} are part of the {@link YaegerScene}, this
 * could lead to many calculations, which could slow down the game and framerate. Thus ensure only those instances of
 * {@link YaegerEntity} that really need to be part of the collision detection implement
 * the {@link Collided} or {@link Collider} interfaces.
